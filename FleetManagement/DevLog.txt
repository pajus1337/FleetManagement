Here we will try to publish current progress, options that may be important for further development, etc. : 


Options we initially want to introduce in the console version :

Stage 1 -> Using the example from Kajetan's course :
- An initial skeleton of the project will be created 
  ( which will be developed over time and take on its own character and independent development.)

In the 1 stage, our goal will be : 
* Create a simple menu based on a few functions: 
1) Adding a vehicle
2) Deleting a vehicle
3) Displaying information about a specific vehicle
4) Return vehicle lists based on a predefined filter

1a) Selecting the vehicle type
1b) Adding vehicle details

2a) Entering the ID or registration plate of the vehicle
2b) Vehicle will be deleted

3a) Querying the vehicle ID 
3b) Displaying all information about the vehicle

4a) Entering the vehicle type
5a) Calling up a list of vehicles of a given type

(to be continued soon)
