Here we will try to publish current progress, options that may be important for further development, etc. : 


Options we initially want to introduce in the console version :

Stage 1 -> Using the example from Kajetan's course :

In the 1 stage, our goal will be :
* Create a simple menu based on a few functions: 
1) Adding a vehicle
2) Deleting a vehicle
3) Displaying information about a specific vehicle
4) Return vehicle lists based on a predefined filter

1b) Adding vehicle details ( done )

2a) Entering the ID or registration plate of the vehicle ( Done only for ID part )
2b) Vehicle will be deleted ( done )

3a) Querying the vehicle ID ( done )
3b) Displaying all information about the vehicle ( done )
