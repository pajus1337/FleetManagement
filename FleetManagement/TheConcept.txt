The Concept and application development log.

The concept of this application, as the name suggests, will be : Fleet management, 
in the initial phase we will focus on :
- trucks
- cars

We will create a simple console application in the early stages, but also slowly creating an advanced application backend that will be accessible via http and mobile apps in the final stage
with the use of SQL database.
( based on known and good practices, which we will gradually introduce during the development of the application under the guidance of mentors from the DotNet school. 
(All of this application will initially be for own development of skills in programming, thus educational purposes,
but further development for commercial purposes or as an open source project is not excluded). )


(to be continued soon)
