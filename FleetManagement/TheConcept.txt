The concept of this application :

The main goal of Fleet Management will be to manage a larger number of vehicles (a fleet) to provide the best possible insight. 

As the number of vehicles increases, it is often challenging to keep track of everything throughout the year, including:

   - Inspections
   - First aid kits (which need regular replacement)
   - The ability to report faults that then need to be managed somehow, and also keep an eye on the progress of repairs 
    (whether they have been fixed, when, etc.).
    ... <and this list will continue to grow>

Because there are a multitude of different items and things that need constant monitoring, 
it's certainly beneficial to have everything organized, especially with a larger number of vehicles. 
Moreover, if the system can inform us about upcoming service dates or the need for replacement,or report any issues that need to be forwarded to the workshop,
it will give us more time for much more productive tasks. Our work will become more efficient.

These are just some of the assumptions that we plan to implement in the initial version of our application. 
As I have noticed, our list of available options will constantly expand.

The ultimate goal is to introduce a feature-rich, reliable, and practical fleet management system, accessible via the web, desktop, or mobile app.
This is an additional advantage in terms of easy access and the most practical way to use the application,
whether in the office, workshop, or even when dealing directly with the vehicle.
