The Concept and application development log.

The concept of this application, as the name suggests, will be : Fleet management, 
in the initial phase we will focus on :
- trucks
- cars

We will create a simple console application in the early stages, but also slowly creating an advanced application backend that will be accessible via http and mobile apps in the final stage
with the use of SQL database.
( based on known and good practices, which we will gradually introduce during the development of the application under the guidance of mentors from the DotNet school. 
(All of this application will initially be for own development of skills in programming, thus educational purposes,
but further development for commercial purposes or as an open source project is not excluded). )

But let's get back to the beginning,

Options we initially want to introduce in the console version :


For now, we will create a simple menu based on a few functions: 
1) Adding a vehicle (creating it)
2) Deleting a vehicle
3) Displaying the fleet status
4) Return vehicle lists based on a predefined filter

1a) Selecting the vehicle type
1b) Adding vehicle details

2a) Entering the ID or registration plate of the vehicle
2b) Vehicle will be deleted

3a) Querying the vehicle ID 
3b) Displaying all information about the vehicle

4a) Entering the vehicle type
5a) Calling up a list of vehicles of a given type
